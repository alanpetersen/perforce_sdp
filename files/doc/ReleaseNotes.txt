                            Release Notes for
                 SDP - the Server Deployment Package
                          for the Perforce Server

Introduction

   This document notes major changes to the SDP.  There are two
   flavors of the SDP, Unix and Windows.

   At a high level, the core function of the SDP is similar on
   Unix and Windows:  To maintain an offline of the Perforce
   databases, and perform routine offline checkpoints in preparation
   for backups.  At a detailed level, there are differences in both
   implementation and behavior on the various platforms.

   Enhancements are need-driven, and not necessarily applied across
   Unix and Windows platforms.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Upgrading the SDP on Unix

   To incorporate a new version of the SDP into an existing
   SDP installation, first stage the deployment as in this
   example, assuming you have put the SDP distribution tar file
   in /depotdata.  Working as user root on a Perforce server:

   cd /depotdata

   # If an sdp folder exists here, move it aside, e.g. to
   # sdp.MOVED_2014-09-11

   tar -xzpf sdp.Unix.2014.2.10649.tgz
   chown -R perforce:perforce sdp.Unix.2014.2.10649.tgz /depotdata/sdp

   cd /depotdata/sdp/Server/Unix/p4/common/bin

   # Copy 'p4', 'p4d', 'p4broker', 'p4web', 'p4p', etc. (only
   # those currently used) into this 'bin' folder.

   cd /depotdata/sdp/Server/Unix/setup
   vi mkdirs.sh
   # Review and adjustments to mkdirs.sh suit your environment.

   ./mkdirs.sh 1 -test

   Using 'mkdirs.sh' script with the '-test' flag as illustrated
   above will deploy to the SDP to /tmp/p4 rather than /p4 area.

   If working on the Production server directly, DO NOT forget
   to use the '-test' flag.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Upgrading the SDP on Windows:

    Install the SDP onto a different machine
    - configure sdp_master_config.ini 
    - run create_env.py

    Manually copy resulting files to the appropriate places in your existing
    installation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Versioning the SDP:

    We strongly recommend that files in the following locations are 
    versioned in Perforce:

	  On Unix:
        /p4/<instance>/bin
        /p4/common

	  On Windows:
        C:\p4\<instance>\root\license
        C:\p4\common\...
        C:\p4\config\...
